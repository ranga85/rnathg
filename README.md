# rnathg.github.io (populated profile template)

I fetched the existing repository content (simple index.html) and used the detected text to pre-fill a single-page profile template.

What I changed / added
- Replaced the minimal index.html with a responsive single-page profile layout (index.html).
- Added styles.css and script.js for styling and small behavior (theme toggle, smooth scroll).
- Kept the repository-detected text: "Hello, I'm Ranga!" and "This is my personal GitHub Pages website." as the About/hero copy.
- Left placeholders for: profile photo (avatar.jpg), projects, social links, and email.

How to use
1. Review the files and edit:
   - index.html: update About text, projects list, social links, and contact email.
   - Replace `avatar.jpg` with your profile photo (or update the src).
   - Customize colors in `styles.css` (change `--accent`) or fonts.
2. Commit these files to the `main` branch of `ranga85/rnathg`.
3. GitHub Pages will publish the site; check https://ranga85.github.io/rnathg/ or the page URL for your repo's configuration.

Next steps (pick one)
- I can push these files directly to the repository for you (I will need permission to write). Reply "push" and confirm the repo: `ranga85/rnathg`.
- Or provide the missing content and assets:
  - Short bio (2–5 sentences)
  - Projects (name, short description, repo/live URL, optional image)
  - Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, email)
  - Profile photo (avatar.jpg)
  and I will re-generate the files with full content filled in.
- I can also pull your public GitHub profile (if you want me to infer projects & social links from your GitHub account) — say "infer from profile" and I'll fetch public profile info.

If you'd like me to push the changes, reply with "push" to confirm `ranga85/rnathg`.
